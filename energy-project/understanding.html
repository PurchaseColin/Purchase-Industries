      <p>Energy is the capacity to do work.</p>
      <p>
        Work is any action that is done in an attempt to change the
        configuration of a system against a force that opposes such a change in
        that system. Gravitional, heat, kinetic, elastic, electric, chemical,
        nuclear, mass and radiant arr all the different forms of energy. We see
        this phenomena manifest itself in unique distinguishable ways therfore
        it is difficult for the human mind to resolve this idea into a singular
        entity, None the less, we know that it is omnipresent in pur world and
        pervades every aspect of our human lives. No interactions, cosmic or
        micro can take place without the conversion of energy from one of its
        forms to another.

        Our first exosomatic energy conversion began when homosapien ancestors
        discovered and tamed the phenomna of the flame. Fire allowed us to cook
        otherwise inedible wild meat, keep warm and defend ourselves against
        more fiersome predators. Mainly our fuel for fire was wood but the
        discovery of fossil fuels changed our world completly. Our ancestors
        discovered that there was an enormous amount of energy stored in the
        presurized hydrocarbons of once living plants and animals.

          The transition to fossil fuels began with the use of coal to power our
          steam engines. to generate our electricity and to synthesize the
          necessary materials in which form the pillars of modern civilazation.
          The next phase was that of the use of crude oil to power our innternal
          combustion diesel engines which are the prime movers in the way human
          beings transport mass across sea, land and air. The following phase
          was the introduction of natural gasses used in the heating of homes,
          rocket propellant, and the synthesois of arguably the most
          existentially fundamental molecule to human civilization, ammonia.
